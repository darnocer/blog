I love reading non-fiction, yet I find if I simply read the book, I barely even remember what I read let alone am able to effectively apply the practical lessons to my life.

Thanks to some cool tools, I've been able to come up with a system to actually use what I read, even reading at an average rate of one book per week. It's had a positive reinforcement on me for reading in that I'm able to see how it improves my life which makes me more excited to read more.

## Tools You'll Need

In this article, I'm using a few specific tools, although the methodology could be applied with other similar tools of your choice.

### <span className="list-heading">Kindle or e-reader</span>

While I love the feeling of holding a physical book (and love to hoard them, too), it's most efficient to utilize an e-reader device so you can automatically sync the notes and highlights from the books directly to your computer. It also has the benefit of being searchable, if you want to see additional context from the book when reviewing a particular note or highlight.

<details className="callout"><summary>Using physical books </summary>
Occasionally, for one reason or another, I do use physical books because that's the version of the book I have. But it takes substantially more time since you have the added step of transcribing your notes to your computer. If you do need to use a physical copy of a book, one tip I've found is utilizing dictation goes much faster than re-typing the highlighted text. I have a hotkey setup on my Mac to press the `ctrl` key twice to enable dictation. </details>

### <span className="list-heading">Readwise or a way to access highlights</span>

If you read a lot, Readwise is well worth the monthly subscription fee. I'll get into some details about using Readwise in the section below.

If you don't want to pay for the subscription, I go over some other options to access your highlights here (they are not as good as Readwise, though)

### <span className="list-heading">Obsidian or a note-taking app</span>

Obsidian is my note-taking app of choice, so the tips will be specific to Obsidian. However, Readwise has many integrations that you may be able to apply this workflow to.

## Setup

Getting setup with Readwise is easy. Once your Readwise account is connected to your Obsidian app and you have the Readwise plug-in installed, you can configure where your book notes will sync (I keep a separate ðŸ“– Readwise folder) as well as the frequency of the syncs (you can set it to be automatic, or I like to trigger the sync with a hotkey: `âŒ˜ â‡§ R`).

## Beef Up Your Workflow

When you sync your notes and highlights via Readwise to Obsidian, they will pull in as a bulleted list by default. You can adjust the format in which your notes pull in.

### Chapter headings

Since the notes pull in as a bullet list, I wanted to find a way to organize the highlights by book sections and chapters. It turns out Readwise supports this natively, although there is some manual annotation required.

In order to have your highlights sync organized with chapter headers, you can apply heading tags such as `.h1` and `.h2` while reading.

So for instance, if the book you're reading is divided into parts, you'd highlight the title for Part I and Part II and apply an `.h1` tag with a note. Then, for each chapter title, you'd apply an `.h2` tag.

If your book had chapters only without parts or sections, then you'd highlight each chapter titles and add an `.h1` tag.

Readwise will automatically recognize these tags and pull them into your notes as headings. Unfortunately, there's no way that I've found to avoid this manual tagging. But once you're used to it, it's not too bad.

You can read the article from Readwise about this [here].

### Tags

Readwise always natively supports tagging. They know it's a pain in the ass to add these tags, so they make it as easy as possible. Firstly, tags are initiated with `.` which is the symbol that doesn't require an extra click on a Kindle reader device. Secondly, Readwise supports adding tags as shorthand, in which you can rename in the app, and it will remember that you renamed them.

So for instance, let's say I was writing an article about writing, and I come across a good quote I can use in the book I'm reading. I can highlight the passage and add my shorthand tag `.w`. Then, from my Readwise account, I'll see all highlights tagged with `.w`. I can then rename `.w` to `.writing` and Readwise will remember that for future passages I highlight with `.w`.

I've also modified the format of the tags in my highlights so I can easily pull them out. For instance, by default, any tags are added like this: \_\_\_\_\_\_

You can modify the format, for example, to highlight tags as inline code:

Then they will appear like this:

### Checklists

The highlights will pull in as a bulleted list. I don't force myself to integrate each and every highlight into other notes. But I do pick out select notes to assimilate into new or existing notes.

When I've migrated a particular note or highlight to a separate note, I like to make the line item a task and cross it off. That way, I can retain the original quote intact with the link to the location in the book in my book notes. Crossing it off helps me ignore it if I'm scanning the highlights since I'm likely looking for a particular quote to integrate into my notes, and the ones that have been crossed off have likely already been assimilated into their proper note.

I have a few hotkeys setup for tasks which you can read about here:

### References

When I assimilate a particular quote or highlight into another note, I always link it back to the book note so I can see the original reference.

I do this with a plug-in called Footnotes. Footnotes allows you to setup a hotkey to add a footnote. My hotkey is `âŒ¥ â‡§ 6` which is easy for me to remember since adding a superscript requires using the `â‡§ 6` keys to produce the carat (`^`) symbol. So by adding option (`âŒ¥`) I know it's another option for that key combo.

I have Footnotes setup to then add a "References" section at the bottom of the note, where I simply use wikilinks to link back to the original book note. This keeps everything linked up.

If I search for a particular word or phrase, I will then see both the source passage from the book note as well as where I added it in the context of my notes.

### Reviews

I don't hold myself to any particular review schedule to review my book and literary notes. I highlight a substantial amount of reading daily, yet I don't always find it immediately prudent to review and assimilate each word.

I typically utilize the tags as much as possible when I read a passage I know I already have a note for or will want to create a note on. Then, in my morning reviews, I'll scan for those tags and quickly assimilate them into the relevant note.

If a book is particularly engaging, relevant, or otherwise insightful for my life, I will set aside time to review the highlights in full and summarize the key takeaways in my own words.
