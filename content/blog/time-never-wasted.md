Meditation, prayer, and self-inquiry are NEVER a waste of time. You may feel as if you _should_ be doing something else. This very feeling reinforces the need to spend more time in spiritual practice.

- **Meditation:** Sitting in silence, observing thoughts without judgement. It doesn't need to be a big thing. Mindfulness can be [a simple practice](/a-simple-practice ). 
- **Prayer:** Prayer doesn't need to be to "God" or a specific god, you can simply pray to yourself or send it out to the Universe. A simple prayer template is: _help_ (something you need help with), _thanks_ (gratitude), _wow_ (awe and amazement). 
- **Self-Inquiry:** This is honest reflection and contemplation about yourself, your behavior, and your actions. 

Pick one of these practices, and make [The Choice](/a-simple-choice) to commit to doing your practice daily. Note it is best to save self-inquiry for later after learning meditation, as contemplation with an untrained mind can potentially be detrimental to your progress. 

Start with 10 minutes at the same time in the morning, every morning. If you do this for just 30 days, you will truly be amazed by the results. 

Slowly increment over time and incorporate spiritual practice in other areas of life outside of your morning routine. Work your way up until there is no separation between "practice" and life. 

Be patient with yourself, as this process may take years. But if you are dedicated, the results will speak for themselves and you will wonder why you didn't make the time sooner.
