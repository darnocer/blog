Many people put pressure on themselves to sit in meditation because they feel they _should_, only to judge themselves when they don't live up to their own expectations. This very relationship with meditation can reinforce the same attachment and suffering cycle that the practice is intended to alleviate.

But meditation doesn't have to be a structured routine that requires setting aside time. Meditation is a _practice_ on the cushion for life off the cushion. So why not remove the pressure by bringing the practice into everyday life?

The practice is simple: **"begin again"**. Any time, any where, the moment you remember to practice, simply "begin again". It is a simple choice, in each moment, to be fully present with whatever you are doing.

Eventually, the gaps in between periods of mindfulness begin to shorten, and the line between "practice" and "life" begins to dissolve. 

It is in the present moment where we find, quite literally, everything that we seek. Our True Nature, God, Happiness, and Peace are only available in the Now. And the Now is always available.
