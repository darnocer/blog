[The Power of Now by Eckart Tolle](https://shop.eckharttolle.com/collections/books/products/the-power-of-now?variant=7433430499358) is a classic in the spiritual self-help category and is possibly the most influential spiritual book of our time. It is worth a read for anyone that struggles with anxiety and overthinking or is interested in the path of spiritual growth and mindfulness.

Below are some of my favorite book highlights from the book which I've organized into different sections and personally refer to often. I highly recommend reading the full book (more than once) but if you just need a refresher or a little dose of how to navigate the present moment, below is a good reference.. enjoy :)

## <span className="bold-underline">On the importance of presence:</span>

- The present moment is all you ever have. <sup>[pg. 35]</sup>

- There was never a time where your life was _not_ now, nor will there ever be. <sup>[pg. 49]</sup>

- Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry — all forms of fear — are caused by too much future, and lack of presence. <sup>[pg. 61]</sup>

- Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence. <sup>[pg. 61]</sup>

- Why are you always anxious? Jesus asked his disciples. "Can anxious thought add a single day to your life?" <sup>[pg. 76]</sup>

- Are you so busy getting to the future that the present is reduced to a means of getting there? Stress is caused by being "here" but wanting to be "there". <sup>[pg. 84]</sup>

- Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free _now_. <sup>[pg. 62]</sup>

- To know that you are not present is a great success: that knowing _is_ presence. <sup>[pg. 72]</sup> [^1]

## <span className="bold-underline">On the mind:</span>

- Once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identification with the mind... you step out of it. ... When you are present, you can allow the mind to be as it is without getting entangled in it. <sup>[pg. 48]</sup>

- To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and allow it to be.<sup>[pg. 48]</sup>

- Whenever you are able to observe your mind, you are no longer trapped in it.<sup>[pg. 55]</sup>

## <span className="bold-underline">On goals and the future:</span>

- If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. <sup>[pg. 57]</sup>

- You can be aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your full attention to the step you are taking at this moment. <sup>[pg. 57]</sup>

- If your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, are taking up so much of your attention that they are more important than the step you are currently taking now, then you completely miss the journey's inner purpose, which has nothing to do with _where_ you are going or _what_ you are doing, but everything to do with _how_. <sup>[pg. 88]</sup>

- The sooner you realize your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better. <sup>[pg. 89]</sup>

## <span className="bold-underline">On problems:</span>

- Certain things in the past didn't go the way you wanted them to go. You are still resisting what happened in the past, and now you are resisting what _is_.<sup>[pg. 62]</sup>

- Hope is what keeps you going, but hope keeps you focused on the future and therefore perpetuates your denial of what _is_.<sup>[pg. 62]</sup>

- ... It is impossible to have a problem when your attention is fully in the Now. A situation that needs to be either dealt with or accepted— yes. Why make it into a problem? Why make anything into a problem? Isn't life challenging enough as it is? What do you need problems for?<sup>[pg. 64-65]</sup>

- "Problem" means that you are dwelling on a situation mentally without there being a true intention or possibility of taking action now and that you are unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. <sup>[pg. 65]</sup>

- When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a simple choice, a simple decision: no matter what happens, **I will create no more pain for myself**. I will create no more problems. <sup>[pg. 65]</sup>

## <span className="bold-underline">On taking action:</span>

- Allow the present moment to be. Accept— then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. <sup>[pg. 35]</sup>

- If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally. If you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those three options, and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences. <sup>[pg. 82]</sup>

- How can we drop negativity? By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are holding in your hand? How do you drop some heavy and useless baggage that you are carrying? By recognizing that you don't want to suffer the pain or carry the burden anymore and then letting go of it.<sup>[pg. 79]</sup>

- Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it's no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing.<sup>[pg. 83]</sup>

- Is fear preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge the fear, watch it... be fully present with it. <sup>[pg. 83]</sup>

## <span className="bold-underline">On the past:</span>

- Whatever you need to know about the unconscious past in you, the challenges of the present will bring it out. If you delve into the past, it will become a bottomless pit. There is always more. You may think you need more time to understand the past or become free of it, in otherwords, that the future can free you of the past. This is a delusion. Only the present can free you of the past. More time cannot free you of past time. <sup>[pg. 90]</sup>

- The more attention you give the past, the more you energize it, and the more likely you are to make a "self" out of it. Attention to your present moods, thoughts, emotions, fears, and desires will reveal the past in you. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. <sup>[pg. 91]</sup>

- As long as you make an identity for yourself out of the pain, you cannot become free of it. As long as a part of your sense of self is invested in your emotional pain, you will, unconsciously resist or sabotage every attempt that you make to heal that pain. Why? Quite simply because you want to keep yourself intact, and the pain has become an essential part of you.<sup>[pg. 168]</sup>

## <span className="bold-underline">On relationships:</span>

- If you observe unconscious behavior in your partner, hold it in the loving embrace of your knowing so you won’t react... The energy form that lies behind hostility and attack finds the presence of love absolutely intolerable. If you react at all to your partner's unconsciousness, you become unconscious yourself. But if you then remember to _know_ your reaction, nothing is lost <sup>[pg. 158]</sup>

- You cannot transform ... your partner. All you can do is create space for transformation to happen, for grace and love to enter. <sup>[pg. 158]</sup>

- When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all judgment ... To relinquish judgment does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction and unconsciousness when you see it. It means "being the knowing" ... Instead of fighting darkness, you bring in the light. Instead of reacting to delusion, you see the delusion but at the same time you look through it. Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and people to be as they are. **No greater catalyst for transformation exists**. If you practice this, your partner cannot stay with you _and_ remain unconscious.<sup>[pg. 160]</sup>

- If you are consistently present in your relationship, this will be the greatest challenge for your partner. They will not be able to tolerate your presence for very long and stay unconscious. If they are ready, they will walk through the door you opened for them and join you in that state. If they are not, you will separate like oil and water. The light is too painful for someone that wants to remain in darkness.<sup>[pg. 164]</sup>
