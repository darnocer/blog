## Abstracting the code of our world

Like the majority of people in modern civilization, you likely use a computer on a daily basis. But have you ever thought about how computers actually work? 

As you may know, the "atoms" of  a computer come down to 1s and 0s. But what does that actually mean? Where do these 1s and 0s even come from? 

The first computers were size of a room, with very low computing power. The first computer code was developed by running an  electrical current through a wire with a transistor. Using the transistor, we could turn the current ON or OFF, corresponding to 1 and 0, respectively. And so, with the advent of the transistor, the first computer language was born. 

So how do we get from digital 1s and 0s to what we have today? How do 1s and 0s lead to a modern computer where we can move a mouse around on the screen, type text, and browse the internet (among many, many other things)?

This occurs through a process called "abstraction." 

For programmers, abstraction is a fundamental concept. It's how we get modern development frameworks like React— React is simply an "abstraction" of Javascript, the underlying language in which the framework is built.

Javascript was abstracted from its predecessor, and so on. So starting from 1s and 0s, we could abstract to introduce conditional logic, and continue the process of abstraction to get modern programming languages. And these programming languages continue to be abstracted as technology exponentially grows.

> 1s and 0s:

> 1. Store the number 0 in memory location 0
> 2. Store the number 1 in memory location 1
> 3. Store the value of memory location 1 in memory location 2
> 4. Subtract the number 11 from the value in memory location 2
> 5. If the value in memory location two is the number 0, continue with instruction 9
> 6. ...

> Programming language:
> ```
> Set "total" to 0
> Set "count" to 1
> [loop]
> Set "compare" to "count"
> Subtract 11 from "compare"
> If "compare" is zero, continue at [end]
> ```
> Javascript:
> ```js
> let total = 0, count = 1;
> while (count <= 10) {
> total+= count;
> count += 1;
> }
> ```

For a non-coding example of abstraction, take American Sign Language. In order to come up with hand signs for sign language, the English language needed to exist first. American Sign Language is essentially an abstraction of the English language, with symbols representing English words. 

And English words? Well, at one point they were invented. But they were invented as an abstraction to describe physical objects, symbols, and concepts. We assigned "cat," a sound we make with our mouth to refer to the animal, but the word "cat" didn't need to exist for the animal to exist. 

When we say something is an "abstract" concept, we are saying it is a representation of an idea that does not have a physical, concrete existence that can be perceived, but rather is a complex notion derived from physical observations. 

Things like love, freedom, justice, and beauty are abstract because they are constructs of the mind (though not to say they are not real). You can't reach out and touch "love,", but the computer processor known as your brain can take in inputs— like the look in your lover's gaze, the caress of a hand, the increase in heart rate— and derive a more complex and abstract notion based on these inputs. 

Our modern school system use standardized tests and a standardized learning environment that doesn't work for everyone, which teaches many young people to develop an aversion to math and physics when they inevitably struggle to understand complex concepts in a less-than-ideal environment. It has been my observation that when someone thinks they suck at math, a belief formed in childhood, they avoid it for the rest of their lives. 

I think that's unfortunate, because you don't need to be a math whiz to cultivate an appreciation for the beautiful way numbers and math unfold in our world.  While our modern number and mathematics systems involves complex and imaginary numbers, some of the most interesting patterns in nature occur with rational numbers, in other words whole numbers and simple fractions in ratios like ½, 2/3, 3/4. 

We may have invented the symbols that represent numbers and their calculations, but we certainly did not invent math. We discovered it. The patterns found in numbers and geometry pervade the history of human civilization. Civilizations that didn't speak our same language understood our same math. 

In fact, if we were to encounter an intelligent being ANYWHERE in our Universe, we would expect them to understand this math. 

Take the Fibonacci sequence (I have to laugh, because my partner was an architect major, and nothing makes her groan quicker than the mention of "Fibonacci").

C'mon, you know the one:

The Fibonacci Sequence, a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, is a mathematical equation that manifests EVERYWHERE in biological settings, from the leaves on a stem to the pattern of seeds in a sunflower to the spiral on a snail shell. The Golden Ratio, related to the Fibonacci sequence, is a mathematical ratio that is attributed to aesthetically pleasing designs and patterns, hence the relation to architecture.

Groan if you will, but can you not help but wonder WHY this pattern exists everywhere? From a galaxy, to a hurricane, to even musical patterns and art. That's one hell of a coincidence .... 

The implications of this suggest that there is an underlying symmetry beyond our comprehension that pervades everything in the Universe.
