I thought I had done it. 

I thought I had it alllll figured out. 

(... Lol.) 

In my mid-twenties, I experienced a spiritual awakening— an experience so profound and life-altering, it fundamentally shifted how I viewed myself, others, and the world.

Amidst this awakening, I felt radical self-love, accompanied by increased confidence, contentment, peace, and joy— all feelings that were genuinely new to me. 

And like that, I thought all of my problems were solved. I naively believed I would be in that state of bliss for the rest of my life. 

Life continued to happen, as it does, and after a series of challenges, I found myself living in darkness once again. The only difference was this time, I was painfully aware of it; painfully aware of how far I was from the light I had once glimpsed.

To cope with the dissatisfaction in my life, I became obsessed with building my future and achieving goals— without even knowing what those goals were. I felt stuck in a cycle of endlessly spinning my wheels, constantly feeling like I _should_ be doing something, but never knowing exactly what it was that I should be doing.

In effect, I stressed myself out **because I was “here,” but I wanted to be “there”.** 

Burned out and desperate for a change, I left my high-income job without a plan. Almost immediately, in a streak of luck, I landed a few freelance gigs faster than expected. And just like that, I became self-employed overnight— achieving a dream I had held for years. 

And guess what?

I still wasn’t happy.

Before I knew it, I was already chasing the next goal.

> Just _maybe_ when I finally achieve THIS thing, THEN I can finally be happy…

While leaving my job brought some relief, I had to come to terms with the fact that none of my milestones had ever made me happy before, so why would the next one be any different?

I knew the only way to break the cycle of dissatisfaction was to change my perspective.

I learned that happiness is not an aspiration for a future state, nor is it a state we can arrive at permanently. It's only ever possible to be happy in the present moment— right <span className="bold-underline">NOW</span>.

I had to accept that there was not a future point in time when my life would magically be devoid of all problems and I'd have all of my desires fulfilled so I could finally be happy. 

I had to accept that achieving results or goals may bring happiness for a brief moment, but it's only temporary, and not a ticket to lasting fulfillment. 

I resolved to let go of the results and fall in love with the process— showing up each day with curiosity and a willingness to experiment, rather than fixating on the end goal.

I began to take things less seriously— to smile at mistakes, looking for the lessons in each failure. 

I decided to choose joy in each moment. After all, if you’re not enjoying life, what’s the point?

Above all, I committed to a practice of living in the present moment, the only place where true happiness is always available. 

These changes in perspective allowed me to really settle into the journey that is life, accepting it fully with all of its ups and downs, rather than living from one milestone to the next, perpetually dissatisfied with each successive accomplishment. 

When I fully surrendered to the present and let go of preoccupation with the future, I found it easier to take meaningful action in the moment— actions that, ironically, better served my future self.

Knowing this, it feels almost absurd not to make an effort to live in the present moment— the only place where life actually happens.

In the end, there's no where to arrive. 

**You're already here.**
