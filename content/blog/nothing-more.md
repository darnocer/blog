I blew a spider off of the table today
She startled me
and I didn't want her there

So I blew her off 
with my breath
like a gust of wind
and she dropped onto the ground

I didn't intend
to harm this creature
She didn't know
after all
it was my table

And even if she did
see me 
with her eight eyes

she didn't recognize
that I am
but a mere human

and at the same time
I am
so much more

And yet to her
I am
nothing at all

So how can
I know 
whether
the wind is
nothing more
