We all long to be understood. Language is the vehicle in which we share our thoughts and feelings— what's going on on the inside— with the outside world. The purpose of language is communication, and the priority of communication in most cases is clarity, so the other person can understand what we are meaning to say. 

If we all have the same goals when we speak, then why is it that it's so easy to miscommunicate? Often in a conversation, the other person could repeat back to you what you just said, with the entire meaning twisted from how you originally intended. How often is it that our disagreements are a result of miscommunication and misunderstanding, not an actual disagreement?

I think the obvious answer to this is that everyone interprets language through their own unique "processor". Every individual's brain is uniquely wired based on the experiences that have shaped them throughout life and it entirely informs the lens in which they see the world through.

When we communicate a message to another person, something like the following process happens:

- **Person A** - has an internal thought or feeling
- **Person A** - processes those thoughts or feelings into language and outputs communication
- **Person B** - intakes the already processed language from Person A and processes again through their own unique processor
- **Person B** - arrives at their own understanding of Person A's words

In dialogue, this processing happens not just once, but many times, back and forth. When you see how much room for error there is in understanding during dialogue, it makes sense why miscommunication is so prevalent. A given person's interpretation of another person's idea is then at least two degrees of separation away from the idea itself.

On top of the natural room for error that there is for interpretation based on an individual's experience, language itself also changes and evolves over time, adding another variable into the mix of our understanding.

In high school circa 2009, it started becoming popular to say "literally" as an adjective when you _literally_ didn't mean _literally_. Inevitably, the "grammar nazis" came out of the woodworks to remind you that you're using the word wrong— "that's not what that means, you know."

Do we still talk in _Ye Olde English_? Of course not! The fact of the matter is that language changes and evolves like anything else. Saying "literally" began to make sense in the new context in which it was used. If it's not creating ambiguity in the message, then why not embrace change over being die-hard about following some arbitrary rule?

I love that Henry David Thoreau was actually referencing English grammar in this quote.

I'll admit, I don't always follow English grammar. In fact, I often make stylistic decisions in my writing that I _know_ is not proper grammar.

I exist somewhere in between a rule-follower, and a rule-breaker. If the rules enhance understanding and experience, I'm all for it. If they don't add any value, then t' heck with it.

My thought is, if you know what I'm saying— then, so what?

And if you don't know what I'm saying, but I meant what I said— then, so what..?

At the end of the day, we're all just trying to be understood. We all do our best to communicate who we really are and what we really think and feel, in order to connect with others. 

So by simply having an understanding of the unique processors that exist inside of every human, we can overall increase our understanding of one another. When we increase our understanding, we become more compassionate, and that's ultimately what makes the world a better place.
