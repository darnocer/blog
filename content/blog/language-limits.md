We all long to be understood. Language is the vehicle in which we share our thoughts and feelings— what's going on on the inside— with the outside world. The purpose of language is communication, and the priority of communication in many contexts is clarity. 

If we all have the same goals when we speak, then why is it that it's so easy to miscommunicate? Why is it that it's so easy for someone's understanding of our words to be twisted in meaning from what we originally intended? How often is it that our disagreements are a result of miscommunication and misunderstanding, not an actual disagreement? 

I think the obvious answer to this is that everyone interprets language through their own unique "processor". Every individual's brain is uniquely wired based on the experiences that have shaped them throughout life and it entirely informs the lens in which they see the world through. 

When we communicate a message to another person, something like the following process happens: 

- Person A - has an internal thought or feeling
- Person A - processes those thoughts and feelings into language for communication
- Person B - intakes the processed language from Person A
- Person B -  processes the language through their own unique processor 
- Person B - arrives at their own understanding of Person A's words

In dialogue, this processing happens not just once, but many times, back and forth. When you see how much room for error there is in understanding during dialogue, it makes sense why miscommunication happens so frequently. A given person's interpretation of another person's idea is then at least two degrees of separation away from the idea itself.

On top of the natural room for error that there is for interpretation based on an individual's experience, language itself also changes and evolves over time, adding another variable into the mix of our understanding. 

In high school circa 2009, it started becoming popular to say "literally" as an adjective when you *literally* didn't mean *literally*. Inevitably, the "grammar nazis" came out of the woodworks to remind you that you're using the word wrong— "that's not what that means, you know."

Do we still talk in *Ye Olde English*? Of course not! The fact of the matter is that language changes and evolves like anything else. Saying "literally" began to make sense in the new context in which it was used. If it's not creating ambiguity in the message, then I see no issue embracing change over being die-hard about following some arbitrary rule. 

> [!quote] Any fool can make a rule, and any fool will mind it. —Henry David Thoreau

Henry David Thoreau was actually referencing English grammar in this quote. I used to be a stickler for grammar, but I think this it was primarily in the context of school where I felt I had a clear framework in which I could ensure that points didn't get deducted from my writing assignments. 

As I began writing more for my own enjoyment, then I began to prioritize understanding over rules. This sometimes means I don't always follow English grammar. In fact, I often make stylistic decisions in my writing that I *know* is not proper grammar. If you know what I'm saying— then so what? 

At the end of the day, we're all just trying to be understood. We communicate to connect with others. I think simply having an understanding of the unique language processors that exist inside of every human, can overall increase our understanding of one another.
