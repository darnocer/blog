It seems being "busy" these days is like a badge of honorâ€” if you're busy, you must be really important. 

But, to me, constant busyness is actually laziness. 

Because it's actually quite easy to be busy. It's not hard to fill up your schedule with meaningless activities or things that simply don't move the needle in regards to your goals. 

Being busy indicates a lack of discernment to be selective about where you put your limited time and energy. 

It's a lack of discipline to stay focused on what's truly important to you. 

It's a cop-out; it's an excuse to not evaluate what's truly meaningful in your life so that you can avoid making difficult decisions. 

You can be busy without being productive. And you can certainly be productive without being busy. 

Do less to do more.
