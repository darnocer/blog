Without getting into my whole life story (a story for another time), I had a hard childhood, which created fertile ground for a difficult life. I was, for lack of a better word, asleep, for about 25 years of my life. When I "woke up," I eventually finally found peace. This peace was undoubtedly derived from a deep mindfulness practice, and ample space I created in my life. At the start of the pandemic, I coincidentally started a 6-month boot camp to become a developer. Since I couldn't do anything in the pandemic anyway, I convinced myself that I was just gonna work my ass off non-stop, until I achieved my goal of employment. During this time, I got into a new relationship, I got a new full-time job, I got a new opportunity with a non-profit, so there were a whirlwind of changes happening at once. I didn't even realize how caught I up I got in all of it until a couple years later. I wouldn't reach my self-employment goal until about 3 years later. By that point, I had definitely lost my peace. I was still meditating, going to yoga, and checking the boxes of what I thought provided me happiness in my awakened state. Yet none of it helped to bring long-lasting peace and happiness. I eventually realized, because I was doing all of it to check the boxes of wellness, and I wasn't practicing the underlying mindfulness that it necessary for these modalities to have an effect. I was stuck in this cycle of believing that every second needed to be used wisely in order to stay on track to reach my goals. I used to sit still, and just be. Maybe in the evenings, sitting on my couch, staring at a wall, just thinking, and reflecting. By the time we lost our way again, I wouldn't dare "waste time" just sitting. I had this pervasive sense of anxiety about needing to be productive at all times per day. But this sitting, in otherwords, just "being," is absolutely productive and necessary even to being truly productive in what matters.

I recently read *Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals* by Oliver Burkeman. The book argues that conventional time management techniques and our obsession with optimizing every moment overlooks a fundamental truth of our existence: our time is finite. The author suggests that embracing our *finitude*, as he refers to it, can lead to a more fulfilling life. 

As a self-proclaimed "productivity geek," this book provided a truly life-altering perspective. Of course, I know, and have known, that I will one day die. Yet I hadn't really made the connection about how this inevitable truth could impact my approach to productivity and time management. I truly thought that by prioritizing the setup of an efficient productivity system, I would eventually be able to eliminate the obligations and small things so that I could make time for what truly matters to me. That was, of course, a farce. 

The book continually reiterates the futility of trying to get it all done, which over time, was eye-opening. I realized that I would consistently underestimate how much I could accomplish in a given period of time, consistently plan to do more than I could reasonably achieve, consistently fail at meeting my objectives, and consistently be upset about it. How silly is that? It's truly insanity. 

I also felt personally attacked by the book about my approach to the things I value in life. I refused to choose one thing to focus on, because there were too many things I wanted to do. I put off my projects, because the reality of how much I could get done and how well I could do it prevented me from even starting. It turns out, these are common coping strategies when it comes to avoiding the reality of our mortality. 

Worst of all, my happiness always felt dependent on something that I would achieve at a future point in time. I knew that happiness could only be found in the present moment, and yet I'd continue to delay it— *if only I can just finish this project / achieve this goal / become this person then I can FINALLY be happy.* 

Since reading this book, I've had a complete shift in priorities. I am now happier than I've been in a long time. I've been making progress on projects I've been delaying for months, even years. This is all because I've been able come to terms with the fact I can actually achieve only very little on a given day, and I no longer hold myself to standards I can't reasonably meet. 

I've cultivated patience with the understanding that my daily efforts will add up to big results over time. And my happiness is no longer dependent on those results, because I've found peace with the fact I may not even live to see them, which has helped me grow a greater appreciation for the process, and ultimately, the journey of life. 

So as you can see, I took many lessons from the book, and I think it definitely had the intended effect on me. I highlighted half the book and was compelled to summarize the notes and highlights in my own words, which can help with retention. As this summary evolved, I decided to structure it into an article as I thought it may have the potential to help others, too. I've sprinkled in my own commentary, but all insights and ideas in this post are credit to Oliver. If you resonate with the lessons, I highly encourage you to read the full book. 

Let's get into it... 


## How We Got Here

Sometimes it feels like there's not enough time in the day to accomplish everything you'd like to do. Or everything you "have" to do, even. But the problem of "not having enough time" is a new one. 

Our ancestors didn't experience the notion of "time ticking away" because for them, time was not separate from life— it *was* life. The cows needed milked when they needed milked, the crops needed harvested when they needed harvested. They possessed a level of acceptance and respect for [[Term - Eigenzeit|eigenzeit]]— the German word for the time inherent to a process itself. 

There was no way to make these tasks go any faster than the time that they take. It would have been crazy for anyone to expect to do more within a given amount of time than they could reasonably accomplish. In ancient Greece and Rome, for instance, they understood this level of limitlessness is reserved for the gods.

The mass standardization of time was brought about during the Industrial Revolution in order to coordinate activities across many people. And so, when your livelihood becomes entangled in "using your time well," each moment then becomes valuable insofar as it can be used to fulfill some future goal. 

The billable hour further perpetuated the notion that any activity that doesn't make money is a luxury one can't afford. Time stops being merely the water in which you swim in, and begins to feel like something abstract that you should be able to dominate or control.  

Today, we are plagued with the problem of time. We can never get enough of it. We employ strategies to "manage our time" in order to increase the amount of value we can squeeze from every minute. We get stressed when things take too long. We compulsively plan so that our projects can go perfectly, yet we procrastinate ever starting them. 

We like to imagine that one day, we won't experience so many of these time problems, once we've taken control of the situation and ahold of time itself.  Of course, this is a delusion. <mark class="hltr-yellow">We will forever be entangled in the relationship our society has with time, which doesn't seem to be improving. </mark>

Our only hope for living a fully fulfilled life, I believe, is to recognize our limitations, accept our mortality, and embrace the constraints in which we operate— only then, can you really obtain the most value from life. 

We'll start by exploring these temporal cold hard truths— the acceptance of which are necessary for our evolution. 


## Cold Hard Truths About Time Management 

<span class="full-underline">Everything takes longer than you expect</span>
Ambitious plans to get too many things done almost certainly always need to be re-evaluated. According to Hofstadter's Law, any task will always take longer than you expect, “even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.” You'll never get as much done as you plan to. 

<span class="full-underline">You'll never be satisfied with how quickly things move</span>
The microwave allows us to heat dinner in a matter of minutes. The jet engine has enabled us to go anywhere in the world in a matter of hours. We forget that, compared to what our ancestors had, that these, among other time-saving devices, are luxuries. Rather than feel grateful for how quickly we can now do things in modern society, we've only grown more impatient feeling like we *ought* to be able to do things even faster— and if we had it our way, instantaneously. And yet it only forces us to face the paradox of our limitations: the more you hurry, the more frustrating the things that can't be hurried feel. 

<span class="full-underline">The more you get done, the more there will be to do</span>
The advent of "labor-saving" devices like washing machines and vacuums really saved no time at all for the mid-century housewife, because society's cleanliness standards simply rose. This irony applies any time we become more productive or efficient at anything— our standards simply rise to a "new normal". You'll find, for instance, becoming more efficient with email only results in getting more email; completing your todo list faster, only means more items find their way onto the list; the more we try to squeeze into our schedule, the more things that will inevitably seem important. When we look at things this way, there is really no getting ahead.

<span class="full-underline">You'll never achieve the "perfect" productivity system</span>
We like to think to ourselves that one day, if we build the right habits and apply sufficient self-discipline, we'll finally achieve that "perfect" work-life balance, and then— only then— we'll **finally** have enough time to do everything we care about. Each new productivity technique can feel as if we're on the verge of a breakthrough— as if just one more tip, trick, or hack will unlock the "perfect" system that begins a golden era of totally undistracted, meaningful activity. But the truth is, the day will never arrive when you're finally this fully optimized person, that, at last, has a fully optimized system with everything under control. 

<span class="full-underline">If you wait to do what is important to you, you will have spent all of your time on unimportant things</span>
We like to think that there's a magical point in time in the future where our life will be completely devoid of all problems. On our quest to achieve that perfect system, we spend our days trying to "get through" tasks to "clear the decks," waiting for our opportunity where there's nothing else on our todo list and we can finally get around to what we've deemed truly matters.  When that day never arrives, we'll have to face the reality that we've spent all of our time on things that are entirely unimportant to us. 

<span class="full-underline">If you're not happy now, you won't be in the future</span>
We stay in jobs we're unhappy with expecting a payoff in a future point in time. When we finally get that raise or that promotion, are we finally happy? Maybe it makes us happy for a moment, yet the reality is that reaching a goal *never* brings us long-lasting happiness. When we achieve one thing, we're already working on the next. Happiness is not a permanent state that you can arrive at— it can only ever be found in the present moment. 

<span class="full-underline">Anything can happen at any time and you probably won't be prepared for it</span>
When we say we "have time," what we really mean, is we *expect* to have time. Because we can never be *completely* sure we'll *ever* have the time until after it has already happened. <mark class="hltr-yellow">The totality of modern existence can be traced back</mark> to a few events in history that were nearly impossible to predict— think, the Great Depression, 9/11, <mark class="hltr-yellow">the 2008 Housing Market Crash</mark>, COVID— none of these tragic events could have been predicted or planned for, yet they have all <mark class="hltr-yellow">undeniably influenced our culture and way of life in ways that may render our culture totally different without their occurrences</mark>. At *any* point— whether it's breaking news or a personal text that you receive— *anything* can happen that can completely alter the course of humanity or your individual life as you know it. 

<span class="full-underline">A plan is a way to feel like you're in control</span>
If you think about everything you value most in life, you'll find that, more often than not, they are in your life by chance— not because you planned for them. No matter how much you plan, you'll get things wrong; there will always be outcomes you could have never predicted. It's not to say you shouldn't contemplate the future or how you may overcome obstacles, but writing a plan really just makes you feel in control of things you can't actually control. A plan is nothing more than a present statement of intent about the future— it doesn't guarantee things will go your way. 

> [!quote] "A plan is just a thought." — Joseph Goldstein, American meditation teacher

<span class="full-underline">We procrastinate to avoid the reality of our limitations</span>
Still waiting around to finish your todo list so that you can finally get started on that project you've been thinking about for months? Maybe years? We make many excuses for why we may be procrastinating, but procrastination is often just a strategy to avoid the reality of the situation: you can't do things as fast as you'd like, nor (judging by your perfectionist standards) as well as you'd like, either.  And so if we never start, then we can maintain the fantasy in our mind where we have everything under control and everything is going splendidly. Because afterall, it's much easier to not start at all than to risk failure. 

<span class="full-underline">You may never actually "feel like" doing what you care about</span>
Even after we've defined what's important to us, often, we simply don't *feel like* doing the work. Suddenly, what we're attempting to accomplish seems tedious or boring, and we'd much rather be distracted by our social media feeds. So we wait— maybe, just maybe, we'll feel like doing it tomorrow... 

> [!quote] The Procrastinator's Song
> I don't want to. I don't feel like it. I'll feel like it tomorrow. 

This distraction may be an attempt to avoid the constraints of reality or the risk of failure by not starting work on a project that matters to us.  It seems as though this is an unfortunate paradox of the human existence— when we attempt to focus on something that is important to us, it's uncomfortable, precisely because we value it so much. But whatever your reason for procrastinating, if you wait until you "feel like it," you may never do anything at all.

> “One of the puzzling lessons I have learned is that, more often than not, I do not feel like doing most of the things that need doing. I’m not just speaking about cleaning the toilet bowl or doing my tax returns. I’m referring to those things I genuinely desire to accomplish.” — author Gregg Krech


<span class="full-underline">If you're constantly focused on personal growth, you'll miss the present moment</span>
Those with a "growth mindset" don't see knowledge and ability as fixed, but understand skills can be learned— a critical component to improving performance in any area of life. However, there's a difference between having a "growth mindset" attitude in the present, and constantly striving towards personal growth and some future objective. If you're constantly thinking about or planning for the future, then you're not in the present moment.  And if you're not experiencing the present, are you really having any experience at all? 

<span class="full-underline">Operating on a shared timetable is necessary to build community</span>
Shared temporal rhythms are imperative for building community and allowing deep relationships to take root. <mark class="hltr-yellow">While the 9-5 workday is becoming a bit outdated, we take for granted that when everyone worked 8 hours per weekday with an hour or so commute on either end, society was operating on a shared schedule which allowed us to regularly sync up with our community during the time not spent at work.</mark> With the rise of remote work, and the praise that comes with achieving total sovereignty over how you use your time, it's becoming more and more difficult to build relationships and community because we no longer share this timetable as a society. <mark class="hltr-blue">So you'll find, if you do reach the ultimate goal of complete temporal autonomy, it can be rather lonely. </mark>


<span class="full-underline">You will undoubtedly miss out on nearly everything life has to offer</span>
The world is teeming with endless possibilities. If we also had endless time, then there would be no pressure to ever do anything at all. The fact that our time is limited is the very reason why we do take action. Taking action means saying "yes" to one thing. And when we say "yes," we are effectively saying "no" to the to the zillions of other options we could be doing. In our short lifetime of 80, maybe 100, years (if we're lucky, of course), the choices we make about how to spend our time mean that, consequently, we miss on quite literally nearly everything life has to offer. 


<span class="full-underline">The Universe doesn't give a shit about you</span>

>[!tip] Fun Math from Darian to Make You Feel Small
> There are approximately 1x10[^24] stars in the observable Universe. As a conservative estimate, up to 50% of these stars may have planetary solar systems like our Sun. Data from the Kepler Mission suggests that 22% of the possible solar systems may have an Earth-like planet with the conditions to sustain life. Doing the math, this means **there may be 1.1x10[^23] Earth-like planets in our Universe.** 
> 
> If there were 1 million beings (a conservative estimate of only 0.0125% of the 8 billion people on our thriving planet) on each of the 1.1 x 10[^23] Earth-like planets, that would be a potential of **1.1 x 10[^29] beings in the Universe**. 
> 
> Comprehending numbers of this magnitude is nearly impossible as a human being. To put these numbers into perspective, the estimated number of the grains of sand on Earth is 10[^18], far less than the potential number of Earth-like planets in our Universe. The difference between 10[^23] and 10[^29] alone is like comparing a single drop of water to the volume of all of the water from all of the oceans on Earth. 

The vast scale of the Cosmos is truly incomprehensible. Whether or not you believe God has a grand plan for your life, whatever you do today or tomorrow will have no material impact on the Universe as we know it.

<span class="full-underline">Tomorrow isn't guaranteed</span>
And for the most sobering truth of all that trumps everything: Tomorrow isn't guaranteed. Everyone who has ever lived, has died. I'm going to die. You're going to die. We're all going to die. While we can only hope for a long and prosperous life, this statistical fate can meet us at any moment. 

## How To Cope

Phew. Ok that was rough. Sorry about that, friends. Now that I've shattered your dreams, let's pick back up the pieces ..... 


<span class="full-underline">Cosmic Insignificance therapy</span> 
Whether or not you believe God has a grand plan for your life, the fact is you will die. We don't just share in this in common with our fellow humans and our ancestors before us, but with every living THING. And not only in on planet Earth, but in the whole Universe. We have death in common with the stars and the galaxies. When a star in a distant galaxy implodes, it doesn't affect our daily life, just like our death won't impact the lives beyond those who we are connected to. 

If the last cold hard truth upset you, consider the implications of your insignificance: sure the Universe doesn't care about you, isn't that wonderful? The pressure you feel to accomplish something, is only coming from yourself. I've found that when I'm depressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, those feelings fill the entire room. And when you're feeling that way, you're more likely to not leave said room. But if you take a step outside under the open night sky, preferably where you can see the stars, and look into the vastness of the Cosmos, your problems will begin to feel as insignifacnt as you are. Relish in it. Relish in the comfort of Cosmic Insignificance Therapy. 


<span class="full-underline">Admit defeat </span>
Whether you're a compulsive planner or procrastinator, an inbox zero advocate, or desperately working towards temporal sovereignty, you'll never find peace until you take the first step by admitting defeat: you'll never get everything done, you can't be perfect, and you won't have time to do everything you'd like to do in life. Now sigh out a big exhale.  

<span class="full-underline">Meditate on Death</span>
Most people find the notion of our mortality uncomfortable, and so they choose ignore it, understandably. Where I think this becomes more of an issue is when people shut this topic down before it can even begin, and want to change the subject. This indicates to me that they clearly haven't come to terms with their mortality, an inevitable part of the human condition that we all share. I understand not wanting to dive into such a depressing topic all of the time, but you need to talk about it at some point with someone. 

In cultures outside of America, they are more in tune with the reality of our fate: Los Dios de Los Muertos in Spain, and Qingming in China, for example, are both festivals celebrating the lives of those that have died. 


To share something personal: I've suffered from nightmares about the apocalypse on and off for my whole life— typically catastrophic situations like asteroids, tsunamis, and active shooters. These dreams become a feedback loop feeding my subconscious mind and affecting my waking reality. When I notice this is starting to plague my mind, I accept I need to get more comfortable with death. And so, I employ a Maranasanti Death Meditation: a meditation which focuses on death of yourself and those you love. It may sound morbid, but after meditating on death for a bit in my waking life, the dreams and nightmares tend to quiet down. 





3. Embrace our limitations
So at this point, we may have acknowledged our defeat, and now we feel left with all of these limitations. Constraints, it turns out, can actually be a catalyst for creation. If you only have $100 or 48 hours to start a business, you'll get going a lot quicker than if you have unlimited time and money.  If we are constantly failing to meet our goals, then maybe it's because our goals are too ambitious and fall outside of our limitations. It's time to embrace our constraints— what makes us who we are, and what makes us human. We need to be realistic about how much we can accomplish in a given period of time, and embrace those constraints. 


4. Accept "good enough"
Perfectionism is a disease, I believe, maybe even a deadly one. It's certainly deadly to all projects it comes in contact with, that is, if it even allows those projects to start. As a former and recovering perfectionist, I get it. Perfectionists let the fact something won't be perfect stop them from ever starting. And that's a tragedy. Because news flash: nothing can be perfect. It is the imperfections that make things beautiful. We need to accept that "good enough is great" or we'll never get anywhere. 


5. Cultivate a peace of mind in the now
I can't stress this one enough. Are you happy now? Are you at peace with your life? If you answered no, then you need to stop what you're doing, and make that your top priority. That doesn't mean thinking your way through happiness, or being hard on yourself for not being happy. It means, you're not taking enough time for yourself. Truly take the time. That doesn't mean take a break by scrolling on your phone or watching TV. I consider reading a virtue and not a vice, but even that can be a distraction from listening to your own inner voice. It means reconnecting with things that truly bring you joy, or inspire awe. If you don't have hobbies, that's a great place to start. Try doing more things that you do only for the sake of doing them— not to contribute towards some future goal. It may be uncomfortable at first, and feel like you're "wasting" time, but you'll find this deliberate relaxation actually makes you more productive when you do work. I'm telling you— if you're not happy and peaceful now, it's not waiting for you at a future point in time. You can only feel it in the present moment. 

6. Let go of the need for certainty 
As a compulsive planner, I totally get it. But as we accepted above, a plan is a thought. There's nothing wrong with contemplating the future— in fact, I find it a useful exercise to imagine the worst-case scenario and how I would address it if it were to happen. This gives me a sense of peace and preparedness. But the fact of the matter is, we can never be prepared for everything that may happen to us. Pretty much all of the tragedies that have ever occurred came as a complete and total surprise to everyone— 9/11, COVID, the 2008 housing crash. The best you can do is plan for the worst case scenario, and then let it go. Because we can never know what the future holds. It's a rather terrifying notion, but if our priority is building mental strength and resilience in the present, rather than worrying about the future, we'll be a lot better off when the statistically-inevitable tragedies occur. We can cultivate a state of mind where we "don't mind what happens"— it's not to say we don't care, but that whatever does happen, we can accept and find resilience. 

7. Realize your insignificance
Relish in your insignificance. C'mon, it's pretty awesome. You can go outside on a busy sidewalk and lay down in the middle of it and watch people step right over you. You don't matter. When I was depressed, I asked, "What's the point?". And now, I see: that is the point. It doesn't matter if you live or you don't. It doesn't matter if you decide to be a bump on a log for the rest of your life or an adrenaline junkie or if you want to solve world hunger. And that's the magic of life. You can only understand what you value, and what is meaningful to you, and share that back into the world— like a beacon of light or a signal amplifier. Maybe you'll leave a mark, but most likely, you won't. And that's okay. In the grand scheme of human existence, there's really only been a handful of those individuals throughout history. And you probably won't be one of them. And that's fine! That means you can focus on building a life that's made for you. Because truly, what is the point of doing anything at all if it doesn't give meaning to your life? 

8.  Make decisions 
"Keeping our options open" is really just another avoidance strategy. One study found, that when people were forced to make a irreversible decision, they were much happier with their outcome. Remove the option to go back on your decisions. Make your decisions and commit to them fully. Realize, that in most cases, there's no "right" decision. There's trade-offs to everything. So make quickly, and make them sticky. Because every decision in life, even if small, is exactly what makes up our life. 

9. Make a commitment to community 
No one ever said on their death bed, "I wish I worked more". Reliably, the regret of people before they die is wishing they spent more time with their family. Humans need community. That's just a basic fact in life. Again, because the "shared rhythms" of society required for community to form are nearly non-existent, it means we need to create them. Ask yourself whether you are a part of a community that fulfills you. If you're not, chances are you may be searching for something that could be alleviated by connecting with others. 

10. Do the next best thing 
So what does it all mean? Where do we go from here after reading this slightly depressing article. Well, hopefully your impossible standards have crashed to the ground. The next step is to pick up the pieces, and evaluate which is the most important. And get started on that right away. In fact, that's all we can ever do in any given moment: the next best thing. 

## In Conclusion
Look, I'm not trying to be depressing here. If you find it too depressing to think about, well chances, are, you're lying to yourself and your living in a fantasy. And if that's how you want to live your life, you're free to! That's the beauty of it. You don't HAVE to take control of your life. In fact, you don't HAVE to do anything. So if that's true, then why would you do anything other than exactly what you want to do? We need to face reality if we really want to make the most of life. 

There will always be too much to do. Life will never go at our preferred speed. We will never have the perfect productivity system implemented. We will always have problems. Sometimes we'll disappoint others. We can't do it all. So we'll need to make tough choices about how to spend our time.
