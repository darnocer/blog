Are you happy? 

It is human nature to strive for happiness. 

But we can't be happy all of the time. 

Happiness also isn't a destination we can [arrive](/arrive) at. 

So a better question may be: _"Are you content?"_

Contentment **is** a realistic goal. 

If you answered _yes_, congratulations! You are doing great. 

If you answered _no_, you have only 3 options: 
* **Leave** the situation 
* **Change** the situation 
* **Accept** the situation fully

That's it, those are your choices. 

Leaving may not always be possible, but there's almost always _something_ you can change.

And if you can't, your only real option is to accept it _fully_ and to stop resisting reality as it is. Otherwise, you're left with one alternative: **suffering**.

We constantly overcomplicate things. We create problems for ourselves, when there are really only situations. 

But if you don't like the situation you're in, you _do_ have the power to change your relationship to it.

Take control of your life by employing one of these options. 

Stop waiting for life to happenâ€” **make it happen**.
