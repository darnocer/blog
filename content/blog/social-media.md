social dilemma transcript

- " [Jonathan Haidt, PhD] There has been a gigantic increase in **depression and anxiety** for American teenagers which began right around… between 2011 and 2013. The number of teenage girls out of 100,000 in this country who were admitted to a hospital every year because they cut themselves or otherwise harmed themselves, that number was pretty stable until around 2010, 2011, and then it begins going way up.

- " It’s up 62 percent for older teen girls. It’s up 189 percent for the preteen girls. That’s nearly triple. Even more horrifying, we see the same pattern with suicide. The older teen girls, 15 to 19 years old, they’re up 70 percent, compared to the first decade of this century. The preteen girls, who have very low rates to begin with, they are up 151 percent. And that pattern points to social media.  Gen Z, the kids born after 1996 or so, those kids are the first generation in history that got on social media in middle school.


[Jonathan] They’re much less comfortable taking risks. The rates at which they get driver’s licenses have been dropping. The number who have ever gone out on a date or had any kind of romantic interaction is dropping rapidly. This is a real change in a generation. And remember, for every one of these, for every hospital admission, there’s a family that is traumatized and horrified.

# Working Draft

"Discard what no longer serves you...," my yoga teacher repeated, while casting a spell on me. 

Just kidding. But maybe not. 

She repeated this phrase while in Shavasana, the final resting pose, and put her hands behind my neck and I felt energy shoot down my spine. To this day, I'm honestly not sure what happened. But I went home and, without hesitation, deleted all of my social media. 

This was in 2018 and I haven't looked back. 

(Just before someone calls me out— I do use LinkedIn, for professional purposes.) 

I'm often told by friends I'm the only person they know without Instagram / TikTok / Twiter / fill-in-the-blank.. The ONLY person!

It doesn't make me feel like I'm missing out. It honestly makes me feel like I have a super power. 

If you're like most people, you may: 
- Start and end each day looking at your phone in bed
- Catch yourself endlessly scrolling, knowing you should do something else, but literally unable to stop
- Feel like there's not enough time in the day to get everything done
- Have a phone screentime that exceed more than a few hours 

And, if you're like most people, you may have recognized social media isn't the best for you, but the mere notion of living without it invokes fear: 
- You'll miss out on funny memes and trends
- You'll miss out on world news 
- You'll lose touch with friends
- You won't know what to do with your time when you're waiting at a bus stop or in a doctor's office

Right where they want ya. 

I recognize a lot has changed in the social media world in the last 5-6 years. I do work in digital marketing, so I'm not totally in the dark about what it is and what it's like. 

I'm not here to convince social media is bad and to delete all of your profiles. But I am here to encourage you to evaluate your current relationship with social media and to create healthier habits and boundaries for your own wellbeing. 

Firstly, if you're even remotely interested in this topic, I highly encourage you to watch the Social Dilemma on Netflix if you haven't already. The Social Dilemma is a great documentary that details the truth about social media. 

You must first acknowledge the fundamental truth that social media is *designed* to capture your attention. The old adage time is money implies that time is equally or more valuable than money. And what's more valuable than time or money? 

I would argue: your attention. 

> [!quote] "Tell me what you pay attention to and I'll tell you who you are" — Jose Ortega y Gassett

Paying attention doesn't always mean consciously paying attention. Your attention can go on auto-pilot. You might not even be paying attention to what you're paying attention to. 

Your attention is the single most valuable asset any one person possess. You can't do anything— ANYTHING— without paying attention to it. Including, spending money. 

So now that you understand why attention is so valuable, it would make complete sense, then, that companies that can make money by exploiting attention will exploit the shit out of it. 

Tristan Harris argues the fundamental root cause of this social media epidemic is that our incentives are all wrong. And I think he's right. 

Human beings are highly susceptible to incentives. Right now, the incentive is to capture every second of your attention, to keep you hooked, because it means it's more likely they will get money. 

The ad-based model is nothing short of complete evil. However, you can't blame humans for aligning to their incentives. 

Further, I keep saying "humans" instead of companies because we have to remember that humans are behind companies. Yet corporations make it easy to disperse responsibility so no one person is liable for decisions. This further exasperates the exploitation. 

Do you feel gross and icky yet? I sure do. 

I'm barely scratching the surface, and don't worry, it gets worse. 

What's the best way to capture your attention at all costs? Addiction. 

You may like to think you're a conscious human being with complete free will and control over your behavior, actions, emotions, and life. 

Yet you have to realize this technology is in its infancy. The freaking computer has only been around for not even 50 years. technically, the first recorded instance of a computer, in otherwords, a machine that computes is actually 19XX. So let's be conservative and say we've had computers for 100 years. 

The accepted timeline of the origin of human civilization is XXXX BC. XXXX years ago. 

So, since we've created the first computer, 100 years ago, that is a tiny fraction of time relative to how long humans have been around. about 0.0000000XX% of the time. 

And evolution is slow. Like sooooo slow. It takes millions of years. 

So here we are, essentially apes, that now have extremely powerful technology, that is only going to grow more powerful at an exponential rate. 

What I'm getting at is: we are not equipped to handle this. 

We have not evolved out of the innate reward systems we've had since the beginning of civilization. Our brains are basically computers in our head. And spoiler: they're not that hard to hack. 

Companies can take advantage of our programming and make us addicted to staring at our screens. Even when we know we should stop. We literally can't. 

How GROSS. 

And what do they use our attention for? 

TO SELL US SHIT. 

Honestly, once I understood the reality of how social media works, that was enough for me to ensure I never fell into its trap. 

Especially since I work in digital marketing (ancillary), it freaks me out even more. You have to realize when you scroll through Instagram, everyone is trying to sell to you. EVERYONE. 

Sure, maybe posts from Jessica from high school or your one-night-stand Tinder date are sprinkled into your feed to create the illusion that the posts are from real people, but legitamately 99.999% of everything you're seeing is an ad. Even if it's unassuming or doesn't seem like an ad— ad. 

Why? Because as we discussed, the incentives are all wrong. Instagram is incentivized to show you ads. 

Most normal people have been essentially trained to ignore ads. When you see anything that says `ad` or `promoted` , the majority of time you'll just gloss over it or ignore it. Because who likes being advertised to? 

So this means companies have to get creative. They need to make ads inconspicuous, so you don't know you're looking at ads. It's safe to assume everything is an ad. 

Maybe the nature of targeted ads don't bother you because you love buying shit on Instagram. Without the promoted posts, you'd never know about your favorite brand. Well, that's fine. But if it doesn't bother you just a little bit that there are literally people in board rooms trying to determine the best way to steal your attention and data— things that belong to YOU— then, well, maybe there's no hope for you. 

As if social media wasn't a dystopia enough with the attention economy, the addictive nature of the algorithms, and the constant advertising, we all know it has the potential to impact our mental health. 

Social Media is a highlight reel of everyone's life. People only post the best most awesome stuff on social media. The stuff that makes them look good. The stuff that gets likes and reposts. 

Occasionally people are brave and get vulnerable, which I certainly commend, but for the most part, you're not seeing the real story. 

And you may think you're immune to social media controlling your perception of the world and others, but you're not. 


[insert about depression / suicide / jealousy / anger / etc]


The implication that is probably the scariest to me is that there is no longer a shared reality in this world. Everyone is so passionate about their beliefs, especially young people think their viewpoint is literally correct. 

But that's not how the world works. I'm not saying black lives *don't* matter or we *shouldn't* support Ukraine. But you have to admit that ANY viewpoint, even if it's not disagreeing, but that's not exactly aligned to this narrative is considered WRONG. The people that hold those viewpoints are even considered bad people. 

People are terrified to express themselves ... 

[X% of people create X% of content]

Not to mention, with the advent of ChatGPT, released only X months ago as of Jan 2024, AI is increasing FAST. XX% of content is BOTS. 

[Sturgeon's law]

I could write an entire article or even book on this topic, and maybe I will. So for now, I digress. 

Unless you actively seek it, most of what you see on the internet is just AI-generated crap. And how does AI generate this crap? Well, it trains itself on all of the crap that every human has ever said and spits out a processed version of human language. It's like having a hot dog when you could have a steak. 

If you want to waste your life away looking at this watered down garbage, be my guest! But seriously, consider how you're spending your precious time on Earth and if doom scrolling for several hours a day is worth it. 

We only have XXXXXX hours in our entire life time. Check your screen time. Do you really want to spend any notable percentage of your day giving your attention away for free to companies that just want to sell you things, control you, and keep you hooked? Do you really want to participate in the demise of any semblance of a shared reality and any hope for humanity to live together in harmony? Do you want to spend your days looking at something WE KNOW has severe mental health implications? 

Again, I'm not here to convince you how bad social media is. (Although I'm conveniently leaving out any discussion of the positive benefits from social media. I will however acknowledge technology is AMAZING. )

I'm here to make you consider how you're spending your time in this life and if you could be spending it better. I'm here to encourage you to be mindful about your internet usage because you could be living  a better life. 

If you're addicted to social media, you may not even realize how  much of a better life you could even have. 

Since I've deleted my social media in 2018, it's changed my life for the better. Within months, weeks even, I experienced benefits from removing it from my life that I didn't even intend to expeirnce.

You may have read that [I don't use social media]. Well I have another surprising fact for you: I don't watch / read / listen to the news. At all. 

And you don't have to, either. 

"But.. but...," you protest, "I *must* be an informed citizen. It is my DUTY!"

No, it isn't. 

it's possible to legitamately avoid
