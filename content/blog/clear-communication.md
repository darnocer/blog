On a project at my first job out of college, there was a complex technical issue in my area of responsibility that put the entire project at risk. I typed up what I thought was a crystal clear escalation email for the leadership team to explain what the issue was and what we were doing about it. 

As this was my first real escalation, my manager at the time proofread the email. She told me I needed to cut 2/3 of the content... How could I possibly communicate this complicated issue in so little words?! 

I finally adjusted the email to her satisfaction: 2 sentences and 3 bullet points. I sent it off to the project director, sure it couldn't possibly be enough information for her to take action. 

As it turns out, though, it was plenty of information. I actually received praise for the clarity and conciseness of the email, and it was shared as an example escalation email for the team. 

The lesson here is you can often communicate in less words than you think you can. In a work context, you want to clearly communicate the most important information only, with the goal being clarity, not comprehensiveness. Most people are invested in their own work and roles, and don't want to spend more time reading emails than they need to. 

Admittedly, I'm still not the best at this. It almost feels as if I want to give people the courtesy of communicating all of the details I know, but it's, more often than not, simply not necessary. 

As I deal with a lot of technical communication with non-technical coworkers, my rule of thumb is to always cut at least 30% from my initial response so as to not overwhelm with unnecessary information. Most likely, your colleagues won't be impressed by a long-winded communication full of technical jargon— they'll just be confused. 

Here are 5 ways that I ensure clear, concise communication: 
## <span className="list-heading">Remove extraneous words</span>
Like in the story above, especially when the recipient is to take action based on the information received, people will almost always appreciate reading something that is short and concise. 

To remove the fluff: 
- Minimize adjectives and adverbs where possible
- Use short sentences that each focus on one thought, idea, or concept
- Consolidate phrases that can be said with less words like [^1] : 
	- "at this point in time" → _now_
	- "determine the location of" → _find_
	- "is able to" → _can_

## <span className="list-heading">Reduce ambiguity</span> 
Words like *this*, *that*, *it*, and *they* can introduce ambiguity. 

For instance, 

Ambiguous: 
> The team discussed the drop in traffic, and *they* agreed that *it* was alarming.

Updated for clarity: 
> The marketing team discussed the recent drop in website traffic and agreed that the decrease was cause for concern.

More than just introducing ambiguity, it can result in sentences that can be interpreted in multiple ways, like: 

Ambiguous: 
> The project manager said *they* would get *it* done by Tuesday, but *they* missed the deadline.

Updated for clarity: 
> The project manager assured the team that the website update would be completed by Tuesday, but the web developers missed the deadline.

Some ways to combat ambiguous messages: 
- Replace **this** or **that** with the appropriate noun 
- Place a noun immediately after **this** or **that** 

## <span className="list-heading">Format for clarity</span>
When it comes to digital communication, we have extra tools at our disposal to clarify our messages in the form of formatting. 

Some ways to use formatting effectively: 

* When referring to the exact text, such as a field name or value, **bold** or `inline code` formatting
* Use bulleted lists to list any more than two items 
* Use an ordered list when the list must follow a chronological order 
* Utilize *italic* or blockquote formatting to represent someone else's words 


## <span className="list-heading">Be an email superstar</span>
Most people hate reading emails. With this in mind, there are some things you can do to make it less painful for your coworker when your email hits their inbox [^2] :

* For longer emails that are unavoidable, split the email into at least two parts: "Summary" at the top and "Details" below
* Instead of asking an open-ended question, present options to move forward
* Highlight all due dates and action items and put `[Action Required]` in the email subject 
* If you just have a short question or announcement that can fit into the email subject, you don't need to have an email body. Just add the subject with `<EOM>` (End of Message) after it. 

## <span className="list-heading">Learn the shared language of your project</span>
To the best of your ability, especially when working with developers or on a more technical project, try to actually learn the correct words to reference what you're talking about so that everyone can have a shared language. This ensures everyone is actually having the same conversation. 

I work as a website manager, so some examples of platform-specific terminology might be: 
- Wordpress - Custom Post Type (CPT), Advanced Custom Field (ACF), module
- Webflow - Component, CMS Collection
- Sitecore - Item, template
- Drupal - Paragraph, Content Type
