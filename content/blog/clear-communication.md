Out of college, I worked in software implementations for hospitals. Our project teams involved a coordinator/manager pair in different areas of responsibility reporting to a project director. Occasionally, there would be a critical technical issue that would need reported to the project director including the background on the situation and the next steps for resolution. 

One such escalation occurred early on when I was a coordinator. I wrote out an email for the leadership team, and, proud of my work, I showed my manager to proofread. To my discouragement, she asked me to cut 2/3 of the words out! How could I possibly communicate this complex issue in so little words?! I actually thought it wouldn't be possible. 

I trimmed all of the fat I felt I could possibly remove to get the point across and showed my manager once again. And yet, she still had me consolidate into "a maximum of two sentences" with some bullet points. HOW?!

After I finally adjusted the email to her satisfaction, I sent it off to the project director, sure it couldn't possibly be enough information for her. As it turns out, it was plenty of information. I actually received praise for the clarity and conciseness of the email, and it was shared as an example escalation email for the team. 

The lesson here is you can often communicate in less words than you think you can. Admittedly, I'm still not the best at this. It almost feels as if I want to give people the courtesy of communicating all of the details I know, but it's, more often than not, not necessary particularly in a work context. 

In a work context, you want to clearly communicate what must be communicated in as little words as possible. The goal of the communication should be clarity, not comprehensiveness. Most people are invested in their own work and roles, and don't want to spend more time reading emails than they need to. 

Since my junior days, I have since tended to receive positive feedback from my colleagues and clients about the clarity and helpfulness of my communication. I do  try my best to put a lot of conscious effort into my work communications, to limit confusion and back-and-forth to the extent that it's possible. 

Here are 5 ways that I ensure clear, concise communication: 

## <span className="list-heading">Remove extraneous words</span>
Like in the story above, especially when the recipient is to take action based on the information received, people will almost always appreciate reading something that is short and concise. 

To remove the fluff: 
- Minimize adjectives and adverbs where possible
- Use short sentences that each focus on one thought, idea, or concept
- Consolidate phrases that can be said with less words like: 
	- "at this point in time" → _now_
	- "determine the location of" → _find_
	- "is able to" → _can_

## <span className="list-heading">Reduce ambiguity</span> 
Words like *this*, *that*, *it*, and *they* can introduce ambiguity. 

For instance, 

Ambiguous: 
> The team discussed the drop in traffic, and *they* agreed that *it* was alarming.

Updated for clarity: 
> The marketing team discussed the recent drop in website traffic and agreed that the decrease was cause for concern.

More than just introducing ambiguity, it can result in sentences that can be interpreted in multiple ways, like: 

Ambiguous: 
> The project manager said *they* would get *it* done by Tuesday, but *they* missed the deadline.

Updated for clarity: 
> The project manager assured the team that the website update would be completed by Tuesday, but the web developers missed the deadline.

Some ways to combat ambiguous messages: 
- Replace **this** or **that** with the appropriate noun 
- Place a noun immediately after **this** or **that** 


## <span className="list-heading">Format for clarity</span>
When it comes to digital communication, we have extra tools at our disposal to clarify our messages in the form of formatting. 

Some ways to use formatting effectively: 

* When referring to the exact text, such as a field name or value, **bold** or `inline code` formatting
* Use bulleted lists to list any more than two items 
* Use an ordered list when the list must follow a chronological order 
* Utilize *italic* or blockquote formatting to represent someone else's words 


## <span className="list-heading">Be an email superstar</span>
Most people hate reading emails. With this in mind, there are some things you can do to make it less painful for your coworker when your email hits their inbox [^1] :

* For longer emails that are unavoidable, split the email into at least two parts: "Summary" at the top and "Details" below
* Instead of asking an open-ended question, present options to move forward
* Highlight all due dates and action items and put `[Action Required]` in the email subject 
* If you just have a short question or announcement that can fit into the email subject, you don't need to have an email body. Just add the subject with `<EOM>` (End of Message) after it. 

## <span className="list-heading">Learn the shared language of your project</span>
To the best of your ability, especially when working with developers or on a more technical project, try to actually learn the correct words to reference what you're talking about so that everyone can have a shared language. This ensures everyone is actually having the same conversation. 

I work as a website manager, so some examples might be: 
* Platform-specific terminology: 
	- Wordpress - Custom Post Type (CPT), Advanced Custom Field (ACF), module
	- Webflow - Component, CMS Collection
	- Sitecore - Item, template
	- Drupal - Paragraph, Content Type
