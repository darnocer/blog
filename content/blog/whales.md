So what?

The ocean is vast. For us humans, the notion of living underwater in the ocean would be rather terrifying. For me, at least. I'd imagine even if you have an affinity for the ocean, the thought of being in the middle of the sea, especially at night, has to be a little unsettling for anyone. 

Each year, from about November to February, humpback whales make the most remarkable journey of any mammal on Earth: they travel up to 3,000 miles from Alaska down to Hawaii to have babies in the warm, shallow island waters. 

To imagine swimming in the ocean at that distance, naked, with nothing but yourself, as a human, is unfathomable. We simply aren't built for it. Not to mention making the 3-month journey with a newborn. 

It's not to say that a whale's journey is easy by any means, but they're a little better equipped to take on such a feat. For the humpback whale, making this journey to and from Hawaii each year is just a normal part of life. 

A whale first makes this journey back to Alaska with their mother when they're only a few months old. And they continue to do this each year for the duration of their life. 

On the flip side, a whale could never image life above water for a human. The technology we possess and the innovations we create would be incomprehensible to any animal on Earth. But for us, this is just our life. 

Just because creatures like whales can't comprehend computers and technology, by no means, I think, means they're not as intelligent as us. Whales just happened to evolve to be the size of school buses, with big flippers. So yeah, they can't really erect skyscrapers or write books.

> exhibit complex social behaviors, communication skills, and problem-solving abilities


> The neocortex of many cetaceans, for instance, is highly developed and convoluted, suggesting sophisticated processing capabilities for social information, emotions, and even self-awareness. 

> These animals engage in behaviors that indicate cultural learning, such as the transmission of hunting techniques and vocalizations within and across generations, pointing to a level of social and cultural complexity once thought unique to humans.



Communication is a cornerstone of whale intelligence, with species like the humpback whale known for their elaborate songs that travel vast distances underwater. These songs, which can last for hours and change seasonally, are believed to play roles in mating rituals and territorial display, demonstrating an intricate use of sound for social interaction. Orcas have dialects specific to their pods, further indicating a sophisticated level of linguistic ability and cultural identity. Moreover, the capacity for empathy and cooperative behavior, such as orcas working together to hunt or dolphins assisting injured members of their pod, showcases their advanced social intelligence and emotional depth.

The understanding of whale intelligence also challenges us to reconsider our perspectives on animal consciousness and the ethical implications of our interactions with these sentient beings. The evidence of their complex social structures, emotional lives, and capacity for suffering has led to increased calls for marine conservation, the protection of their natural habitats, and the reassessment of whales in captivity.

For instance, whales exhibit complex social behaviors, including intricate communication systems, cooperation in hunting and other activities, and the formation of long-lasting social bonds. Their communication involves not just simple signals but elaborate songs and calls that vary greatly among species and even among different groups within species, suggesting a form of culture and social learning.
