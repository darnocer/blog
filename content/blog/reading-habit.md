I believe a daily reading habit has the potential to greatly improve your mental health. I notice I'm significantly more content in life when I carve out time to read every day. I think this is for a few reasons: 1) It expands my perspective on the world, 2) it forces me to take breaks throughout my day, 3) it's a form a pleasure, so I can always count on it as an enjoyable activity I get to do even on an average day.

You may or may not be familiar with James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). In the book, he outlines how to build a good habit. He argues in order for a habit to stick, you need to: 1) **Make it easy**, 2) **Make it obvious**, 3) **Make it attractive**, and 4) **Make it satisfying**.

Using this framework (partially intentionally, partially accidentally), here are 7 ways I've been able to effortlessly create a daily reading habit:

## <span className="list-heading">Keep a book list</span>

Maintain a reading list in an Amazon wish list (or where ever you buy your books). Any time you hear about a book you're interested in reading, immediately add it to your list so that you always have a plethora of interesting books to choose from. (_Make it easy_)

## <span className="list-heading">Read what feels relevant</span>

When you're ready to start reading a new book, scan your reading list and read the book descriptions to pick one that resonates with you most at that point in time. This ensures the book feels relevant to your life so that you're actually excited to read it. (_Make it attractive_)

- For this reason, I also don't purchase books until I'm ready to read one, in order to avoid an accumulation of books that I no longer feel like reading.

## <span className="list-heading">Pair it with another enjoyable activity</span>

Pair your reading time with something else you love. For me, I make a delicious iced matcha latte with oat milk to drink while I read. If you know me, you know how much I love it. It doubles the enjoyment of the activity and is ultimately just another thing to look forward to. (_Make it attractive_)

## <span className="list-heading">Apply the lessons</span>

When it comes to non-fiction, make the reading worthwhile and actually use what you learn! There are different ways to apply the lessons to your life; I highlight books in my Kindle and automatically sync notes from Kindle to Obsidian (note-taking app) via Readwise. I review the synced notes on a daily or weekly basis and summarize the key takeaways in my own words. Evidence shows that summarizing in your own words helps with retention. (_Make it satisfying_)

## <span className="list-heading">Read multiple books at a time</span>

At any given time, I'm reading at least 2 different books. I'll switch between them depending on my mood, usually reading one book in the morning and one in the afternoon. Again, this ensures you're excited to read the book day-to-day by picking one in the moment that best suits your mood. (_Make it attractive_)

## <span className="list-heading">Keep your book where you read</span>

I set my Kindle on the end table in the living room where I usually sit in the morning when I drink my matcha (or coffee) so that it's easy to remember to pick up the device and start reading. On an ideal day, I'll read for 2-3 hours across two sessions. But since this isn't always possible, reading first thing in the morning before I start my day ensures I get at least 15/20 minutes of reading time in (because lawd knows, I'm not skipping caffeine). (_Make it obvious_)

## <span className="list-heading">Quit if it sucks</span>

I have a rule— If I'm not loving a book, then I simply stop reading it. It's okay to quit. It's okay to not finish books. Reading should be pleasurable, and be an experience that brings you joy. Nothing kills my reading habit more quickly than trying to slog through a book I'm not excited to read. (_Make it easy_)
