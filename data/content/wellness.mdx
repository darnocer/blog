<Heading level="h1" text="Transformational Wellness" />

I support others through what I call <span className="bold-underline">Transformational Wellness</span>— a holistic approach to well-being that goes beyond physical health to integrate mind, body, and spirit, emphasizing **self-discovery** and **inner healing** to create lasting change.

We often compartmentalize every part of our lives— separating work life from personal life, physical health from mental health. But everything is connected; each part of our life **is** our life, and every aspect of our health **is** our health. To find true happiness and fulfillment, we need to acknowledge and balance all parts of ourselves, including our spiritual, non-physical selves.

This path is not about fixing ourselves— it's about recognizing the power we all already possess and remembering who we truly are. It's a process of letting go of that which doesn't serve our greater purpose and embracing our true selves, limitations and all.

I believe every person has the innate capacity to heal, and that the truth they seek is already within them. My role is simply to facilitate that process of understanding, supporting those who are ready to reconnect with their own **Inner Wisdom**.

<Heading level="h2" text="My Tools" />

<Heading level="h3" text="Psychedelics" />

There are many therapeutic tools out there, and not every tool will resonate with every person. **Psychedelics**, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, are one tool that can offer profound healing and transformation for those that feel called to work with them. I advocate the safe, respectful, and responsible usage of psychedelics for informed adults.

I am proud to live in Colorado, where this natural medicine is decriminalized, and access to these powerful healing substances is actively being expanded. I humbly offer **facilitation and integration support** to those seeking to explore the transformational potential of this healing medicine [^1].

<Testimonial quote="My journey with Darian brought new meaning to the terms “thinking” and “feeling”. As a think first, feel later type of person, the journey helped me deepen my perspective and understanding of self. Darian created the set and setting with care and intention, allowing me to pull back the curtain on myself and gain an intuition that is easy to pass by in everyday life. She was a thoughtful steward of the experience, helping me navigate complex feelings and encouraging me to go deeper. Since the journey, I feel more grounded and less restless, often reflecting on the wisdom I gained." author="T.R." />

<Heading level="h3" text="Meditation" />

Pychedelics alone are not a panacea. The importance of cultivating Awareness in all areas of life through a **meditation** or **mindfulness** practice cannot be overstated. Meditation is a life-changing practice that allows us to deeply know ourselves, cultivate compassion, broaden our perspectives, develop mastery over our own minds, and find true inner peace.

Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my studies draw primarily from Taoist, Zen, and Buddhist traditions, as well as nearly a decade of personal experience. As I continue to deepen my own practice, I am called to support and inspire others looking to do the same.

#### Bodhisattva Vows 🙏🏼

In some Buddhist traditions, all practitioners are encouraged to become a **Bodhisattva**— one who dedicates themselves to awakening not just for their own benefit but for the liberation of all beings.

> There are numerous sentient beings in the universe  
> I vow to help them all to awaken
>
> My imperfections are inexhaustible
> I vow to overcome them all
>
> The Dharma is unknowable
> I vow to know it
>
> The way of Awakening is unattainable
> I vow to attain it
