Hi, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. Here I'm exploring the cracks and crevices in, around, and between the intersection of philosophy, technology, and well-being. I'm an independent <a href="https://darian.digital" target="_blank">software consultant</a> by day. While I mostly write for my own enjoyment, I hope you come across something useful or interesting here. Feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:darian@madebyrvg.com">email</a> if you'd like to say hello. Or don't <span className="no-code-bg">`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`</span> Love you, bye.
