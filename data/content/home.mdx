Hi, I'm D, an indefinite \~work-in-progress\~.

I'm still learning (eternally). I just genuinely want to [make a difference](/work/spiritual) in this insane world and I'm seeking the right people to collaborate with. There's no facade for my internet persona; this is me— so take it or leave it.

_Love ya :)_
