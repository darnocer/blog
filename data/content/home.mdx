Hi, I'm Darian. Call me D. Like this website, I'm a permanent work in progress.

Speaking of websites, I currently [make and manage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iTvpI1tIrhsLtupMHxhMja_BJkFOAb55/view) them for a living. But one of my real passions is harm reduction advocacy for psychedelics. I'm the creator of [microdose.wiki](https://microdose.wiki) and I also volunteer with organizations including [Fireside Project](https://firesideproject.org), [Zendo Project](https://zendoproject.org), and [MAPS](https://maps.org).

I [write posts](/posts) about spirituality, mindfulness, and related topics and am currently working on building the [Soul Signals](https://soul-science.com) newsletter. I support others with [Transformational Wellness](/transformational-wellness) and offer guidance for psychedelic healing and integration. You're welcome to [reach out](mailto:darian@soul-science.com) or [schedule time](https://calendly.com/soul-science/30) with me any time to discuss how I can best support you!

I hope you are enjoying your <TimeOfDayText/> &nbsp; :)
