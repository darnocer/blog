Hi, I'm D, an indefinite \~work-in-progress\~.

I'm not going to pretend I have anything figured out because I'm still learning (eternally), but I am excited about what I have in the works. I have nothing to sell at the moment, other than maybe [my time](/work/management). I genuinely just want to [make a difference](/work/spiritual) in this insane world and I'm seeking the right people to collaborate with. There's no facade for my internet persona; this is me— so take it or leave it.

_Love ya :)_
