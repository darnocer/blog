<Heading level='h3' text='A Spiritual Awakening' border={false}/>

After a lifetime of struggling with anxiety and depression, 8 years ago, I made the decision to begin a meditation and yoga practice. At the time, I had no idea that this was a choice that would lead to a spiritual awakening and profoundly alter the course of my life.

Since then, my journey has been full of many ups and downs. After nearly a decade of working in tech, I knew I still felt deeply unfulfilled, but I was unsure how to break free. It wasn't until hitting rock bottom with burnout that I was finally forced to confront the truth and re-evaluate everything in my life.

I walked away from both a job and a relationship that was no longer aligned with who I was and who I wanted to be, and I set out on a quest for **true healing and self-discovery**. What I found was a calling for my life's work: <span className="bold-underline">to help others heal, awaken, and reconnect with their true selves</span>.

I had known this in my heart for a while, but of course, fully embracing my path wasn't an overnight revelation. It has been a long process to unravel my purpose and heal, requiring immense patience, courage, trust, and surrender.

Psychedelics have played a pivotal role in my transformation, expanding my understanding of myself and the world. While they aren't for everyone, for those that feel called to work with them, they can be a profound tool for healing and transformation.

But psychedelics alone are not the answer. Through a dedicated spiritual and mindfulness practice, I found the wholeness and fulfillment I had been searching for was already within me, always available in the present moment. **And I'm confident it's within you, too**.

I am here to support others on their journey of self-discovery and path to purpose and fulfillment. I don't claim to have all of the answers— and you shouldn't trust anyone who does. But I do know every human possesses the capacity to heal themselves, so my role is to simply be a facilitator of that process for those seeking support.

Breaking free from society's expectations is NOT easy— but it is so worth it. This path is not about fixing ourselves— it's about recognizing the power we all already possess and remembering who we truly are. True freedom from suffering IS possible, and I really believe our society needs that healing now more than ever.

The path of spiritual development can often be lonely, but know you don't have to do it alone. I am happy to talk with anyone wanting support and connection on their spiritual journey.
