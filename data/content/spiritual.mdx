<Heading level="h1" text="Spiritual Healing & Transformational Wellness" />

## Overview

I embarked on a quest of self-discovery, and what I've found is a calling for my life's work: <span className="bold-underline">to share deep healing with others</span>. It is something I have known for a while deep down, but it has taken some time over the last decade to both heal myself and unravel how to fully embrace my Path.

The road ahead is unclear and uncertain, as it is for any new adventure, but in 2025, I hope to build on my [existing experience](/work/management), and continue to learn, grow, and make new connections.

## My Tools

### Psychedelics: A Catalyst for Healing

I'm an advocate for the safe, informed, respectful, and responsible usage of psychedelic medicine for consenting adults. Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, have fundamentally altered me as a person for the better and have profoundly aided in my spiritual healing & transformation.

I am proud to live in Colorado, where this natural medicine is decriminalized, and access to these powerful healing substances is actively being expanded. I humbly offer facilitation and integration support to those seeking to explore the transformational potential of this healing medicine [^1].

<Testimonial quote="My journey with D brought new meaning to the terms “thinking” and “feeling”. As a think first, feel later type of person, the journey helped me deepen my perspective and understanding of self. D created the set and setting with care and intention, allowing me to pull back the curtain on myself and gain an intuition that is easy to pass by in everyday life. She was a thoughtful steward of the experience, helping me navigate complex feelings and encouraging me to go deeper. Since the journey, I feel more grounded and less restless, often reflecting on the wisdom I gained." author="T.R." />

### Meditation: The Path to Awakening

Psychedelics alone are not a panacea. The importance of cultivating Awareness in all areas of life through a meditation or mindfulness practice cannot be overstated. Meditation is a life-changing practice that allows us to deeply know ourselves, cultivate compassion, broaden our perspectives, develop mastery over our own minds, and find true inner peace.

Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my studies draw primarily from Taoist, Zen, and Buddhist traditions. While I still have much to learn, I acknowledge the teacher within me that yearns to support and inspire others on their Path. As I continue to deepen my own practice, I offer guidance and encouragement to those looking to do the same.
