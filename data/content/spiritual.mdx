<Heading level="h1" text="Spiritual Healing & Transformational Wellness" />

## Overview

In the last year, feeling a bit lost on my _Path_, I embarked on a quest for true healing and reconnection with my Higher Self. What I've found is a calling for my life's work: <span className="bold-underline">to share this deep healing with others</span>. It is something I have known for a while deep down, but it has been a long process over the last decade to first heal myself, and then uncover what to actually do with my spiritual gifts.

The road ahead is unclear and uncertain, as it is for any new adventure, but I am excited to fully embrace my _Path_. I am humbled by the vast amount of information I do not yet know, and the wisdom and experience I've yet to gain. In 2025, I hope to build on my [existing experience](/work/management), and continue to learn, grow, and make new connections.

## My Tools

### Psychedelics: A Catalyst for Healing

I'm an advocate for the safe, informed, respectful, and responsible usage of psychedelic medicine for consenting adults. Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, have fundamentally altered me as a person for the better and have profoundly aided in my spiritual healing & transformation.

I am proud to live in Colorado, where this natural medicine is decriminalized, and access to these powerful healing substances is actively being expanded.

### Meditation: The Path to Awakening

Psychedelics alone are not a panacea. The importance of cultivating Awareness in life through a meditation or mindfulness practice cannot be overstated.
