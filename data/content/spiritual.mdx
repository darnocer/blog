<Heading level="h1" text="Spiritual Healing & Transformational Wellness" />

## Overview

Last year, I embarked on a quest for true healing and reconnection with my Higher Self. What I've found is a calling for my life's work: <span className="bold-underline">to share this deep healing with others</span>. It is something I have known for a while deep down, but it has been a long process over the last decade to first heal myself, and then uncover what to actually do with my spiritual gifts.

The road ahead is unclear and uncertain, as it is for any new adventure, but I am excited to fully embrace my Path. In 2025, I hope to build on my [existing experience](/work/management), and continue to learn, grow, and make new connections.

## My Tools

### Psychedelics: A Catalyst for Healing

I'm an advocate for the safe, informed, respectful, and responsible usage of psychedelic medicine for consenting adults. Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, have fundamentally altered me as a person for the better and have profoundly aided in my spiritual healing & transformation.

I am proud to live in Colorado, where this natural medicine is decriminalized, and access to these powerful healing substances is actively being expanded. I am actively involved with harm reduction and policy advocacy initiatives including as a volunteer with organizations like [Zendo Project](https://zendoproject.org) and [MAPS](https://maps.org), a participant in the public Natural Medicine Division meetings, and am the creator of [microdose.wiki](https://microdose.wiki).

I also humbly offer facilitation and integration support to those seeking to explore the transformational potential of this healing medicine [^1].

<Testimonial quote="My journey with D brought new meaning to the terms “thinking” and “feeling”. As a think first, feel later type of person, the journey helped me deepen my perspective and understanding of self. D created the set and setting with care and intention, allowing me to pull back the curtain on myself and gain an intuition that is easy to pass by in everyday life. She was a thoughtful steward of the experience, helping me navigate complex feelings and encouraging me to go deeper. Since the journey, I feel more grounded and less restless, often reflecting on the wisdom I gained." author="T.R." />

### Meditation: The Path to Awakening

Psychedelics alone are not a panacea. The importance of cultivating Awareness in all areas of life through a meditation or mindfulness practice cannot be overstated. I am fully dedicated to my practice; though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my studies draw primarily from Taoist, Zen, and Theravada Buddhist traditions.

Meditation is a life-changing practice that allows us to deeply know ourselves, cultivate compassion, and develop mastery over our own minds— while I still have much to learn, I hope to one day share its transformative power with others in meaningful way.
